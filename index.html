                <h2>Harry Potter Success</h2>
                <p>Joanne Kathleen Rowling is best known for her Harry Potter series. This is a series of books
                    that takes you deep into the Wizarding World as you follow Harry, Hermione, and Ron on their
                    adventures throughout the series. While Rowling was traveling, she had a delay between trains
                    and that is when the idea came to life. These novels have received multiple awards, and while
                    she has moved into expanding the series with Fantastic Beasts and other writing, Harry Potter
                    is the beloved series that the world will never forget. To compliment the eight books in the
                    series, every Harry Potter book (Deathly Hollows combined part 1 and 2) have been
                    made into a movie. In 2016, the screen play was released for Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,
                    picking up 19 years after The Deathly Hollows, so fans could continue to read and stay up to
                    date on the new adventures that are taking place in the Wizarding World.

                <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
                <p>In 2000, JK Rowling started the Volant Charitable Trust to combat poverty and social inequality.
                    The funds are also distributed to organizations to aid children, one-parent families, and
                    multiple sclerosis research. From 2001 to 2012 Rowling participated in fund raisers,
                    founded the Children's High Level Group, and was even featured in the 2012 Summer Olympics
                    opening ceremony in London. She has also contributed money and support for research of
                    multiple scleroisis, from which her mother sadly suffered from in the 1990s. She has composed other
                    short pieces, has read alongside Stephen King and others at events, where profits would be
                    donated to the Haven Foundation. She is a supporter of the Shannon Trust, which runs multiple
                    reading plans across Britain to help prisoners who cannot read.
