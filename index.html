                    <p class="heading-tribute-information">Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson was born on April 15th, 1990 in
                        Paris, France. At a young age she
                        attended the Stagecoach Theatre Arts school at Oxford. Her natural instinct for acting was
                        noticed when she won a poetry contest for reciting "The Sea" by James Reeves at the age of
                        seven. She is best known for her role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series.
                        Throughout the series, her character uses her cleverness and logical thinking to help her
                        friends defeat Lord Vordermort also referred to as the "Dark Lord". Harry Potter was not
                        the only film series she was brilliant in, as she has acted in other multiple films including
                        Perks of being a Wallflower, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Women to name a few.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="heading-tribute-overview">Outside of the Big Screen</h2>
                    <p class="heading-tribute-information">Emma Watson has also emerged as a fashionista, with her style
                        catching the eyes of many major figures
                        in the fashion industry. In September of 2009 she announced that she was working with People
                        Tree,
                        a fashion label that promotes fair trade. In the same year she managed to excel into the
                        world of fashion and modeling, as she was chosen to be the face of Burberry's Autumn/Winter
                        collection, and again in 2010 for the Spring/Summer collection. Maintaining her commitment to
                        her
                        education, she enrolled at Brown University in the Fall of 2009. Sticking to it, she graduated
                        with her Bachelors in 2014 with an English Degree. Following her graduation in the same year she
                        was appointed a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador.
