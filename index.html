                <h2 class="heading-tribute-overview">Emma Watson Overview</h2>
                <p class="heading-tribute-information">Emma Charlotte Duerre Watson was born on April 15th, 1990 in
                    Paris, France. At a young age she
                    attended the Stagecoach Theatre Arts school at Oxford. Her natural instinct for acting was
                    noticed when she won a poetry contest for reciting "The Sea" by James Reeves at the age of
                    seven. She is best known for her role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter series.
                    Throughout the series, her character uses her cleverness and logical thinking to help her
                    friends defeat Lord Vordermort also referred to as the "Dark Lord". Harry Potter was not
                    the only film series she was brilliant in, as she has acted in other multiple films including
                    Perks of being a Wallflower, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Women to name a few.
                </p>
                <h2 class="heading-tribute-overview">Outside of the Big Screen</h2>
                <p class="heading-tribute-information">Emma Watson has also emerged as a fashionista, with her style
                    catching the eyes of many major figures
                    in the fashion industry. In September of 2009 she announced that she was working with People Tree,
                    a fashion label that promotes fair trade. In the same year she managed to excel into the
                    world of fashion and modeling, as she was chosen to be the face of Burberry's Autumn/Winter
                    collection, and again in 2010 for the Spring/Summer collection. Maintaining her commitment to her
                    education, she enrolled at Brown University in the Fall of 2009. Sticking to it, she graduated
                    with her Bachelors in 2014 with an English Degree. Following her graduation in the same year she
                    was appointed a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador.
